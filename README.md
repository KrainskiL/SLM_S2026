# SLM S2026
Repository for the course Statistical Learning Methods [223491-D] - Spring 2025/26

**Required software**

During the course we'll use Jupyter Notebook with Python.
To run the code provided during classes you'll need:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for Windows user it's easy to install Python through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/))
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) Notebook or Jupyter Lab
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

You can use your own laptop or machines provided by SGH in the classroom (SGH machines have required software installed.)
